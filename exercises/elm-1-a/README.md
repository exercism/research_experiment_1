## Instructions

Your task is to take a list of scorers for a football game, and aggregate any duplicates.

Your job is to implement the `aggregateScorers` function which takes a `List String` (the names of the players that scored the goals, that can contain duplicate player names), and returns an aggregated `List String`, where each player only appears once, and where the number of goals that a player has scored is included in brackets after their name if they have scored multiple goals. This aggregated list should be ordered alphabetically.

For example:

```elm
aggregateScorers ["Lisa", "Anna", "Lisa"]
-- Returns: [ "Anna", "Lisa (2)" ]
```
