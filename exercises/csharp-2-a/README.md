## Instructions

Your task is to extend existing code with new functionality. The code you'll be working with has a method named `Sentence.WordWithMostVowels`. This method takes a sentence and returns the word that has the most vowels (a, e, i, o, u). A sentence is defined as a [C# string][docs-string] consisting of one or more words. A word consists of one or more upper- or lowercase letters. Words are separated from each other by a single space character.

For example:

```csharp
Sentence.WordWithMostVowels("Hi there aunt jeanie")
// Returns: "jeanie"
```

Your job is to extend this code to deal with tiebreaks - the situation where there are multiple words with the same number of vowels. In these cases the word with the most consecutive consonants (non-vowel letters) should be returned.

For example:

```csharp
Sentence.WordWithMostVowels("his own hints")
// Returns: "hints"
```

All three words have the same (maximum) number of vowels. The most consecutive consonants for `"his"` is 1, `"own` has 2 and `"hints"` has 3. Therefore, `"hints"` is the word that should be returned.

Your task is to add this functionality to the `Sentence.WordWithMostVowels` method.

## Troubleshooting

When a test fails, a message is displayed describing what went wrong and for which input. You can also use the fact that any [console output][programiz.com-basic-input-output] will be shown too. You can write to the console using:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Debug message");
```
