## Instructions

Your task is to determine which word in a sentence has the most vowels (a, e, i, o, u). A sentence is defined as a [C# string][docs-string] consisting of one or more words. A word consists of one or more upper- or lowercase letters. Words are separated from each other by a single space character.

Your job is to define a method named `Sentence.WordWithMostVowels`, which takes a sentence, and returns the word with the most vowels.

For example:

```csharp
Sentence.WordWithMostVowels("Hi there aunt jeanie")
// Returns: "jeanie"
```

## Debugging

When a test fails, a message is displayed describing what went wrong and for which input. You can also use the fact that any [console output][programiz.com-basic-input-output] will be shown too. You can write to the console using:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Debug message");
```
