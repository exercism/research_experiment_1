# Exercism Research: Experiment 1 Track

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/exercism/research_experiment_1.svg?branch=master)][travis-badge]

This is a language track which holds the exercises for Exercism Research's first experiment.

## Exercises

All exercises in this track will be bonus exercises. This means that their `core` property will be set to `false` and the `unlocked_by` property set to `null` in the [`config.json` file][config-json-file]. Here's an [example exercise entry][config-json-exercise].

Each exercise must use the following naming format: `<track>-[1|2]-[a|b]`. The number part indicates which part of the exercise it represents (first part is start from scratch; second part is start with existing code). The letter part indicates which of the two exercises it is (remember: each track should have two exercises).

Each exercise in this repository must be unique, so copying exercises from another language is not an option.

These are examples of valid exercise names:

- `csharp-1-a` : first part of exercise A for C#.
- `javascript-2-b` : second part of exercise B for JavaScript.
- `ruby-1-b` : first part of exercise B for Ruby.

### Config

Each exercise should provide a `.meta/config.json` file as follows:

```json
{
  "solution_files": ["ruby_1_a.rb"],
  "tests": []
}
```

The `solution_files` are the files that will be presented to the user to edit in the browser, and are the only files that can be overriden by a user. The `tests` key is explained below.

### READMEs

Each exercise should provide a `README.md`, which gives instructions for completing exercise. Parts 1 and 2 have some boilerplate that should go at the top. Please refer to the `csharp-1-a` and `csharp-1-b` exercises for examples of text and formatting. Note that `##` should be used for headings.

### Test messages

Solving exercises that are part of the experiment is different from the regular website's process in two ways:

1. Exercises are solved exclusively using in-browser coding.
1. The test suite used to test the code is not available to the user.

This means that when the code does _not_ pass one of the tests, the user won't see the code of the test that failed or the input the code was called with. To fix this, we need to provide a bit of context when we show errors to the user.

For an equality assertion failure, the error with context might look as follows:

> We tried running `MyTests.MyTestMethod(1)` but got the following error:
>
> ```
> Expected: "foobar"
>   Actual: "barfood"
> ```

To achieve this, each exercise should define a `tests` key in its `.meta/config.json` file. This key is a mapping of the test method's name (the `"name"` value in the [test runner output][test-runner-output-format]) to the command that we tell the user was run when the test fails:

```json
{
  "tests": [
    {
      "name": "MyTestMethod",
      "cmd": "MyTests.MyTestMethod(1)"
    }
  ]
}
```

If you would like to provide a custom message (rather than the default interpolated message that we provide), you can also add a "msg" key, which must contain the command, and should in most cases also embed the [test runner's][test-runner-output-format] output (usually the assertion error message) in the message by using `%{output}`. For example:

```json
{
  "tests": [
    {
      "name": "MyTestMethod",
      "cmd": "MyTests.MyTestMethod(1)",
      "msg": "We tried running `MyTests.MyTestMethod(1)` but got the following error:\n\n%{output}"
    }
  ]
}
```

If it makes more sense for the track to describe how to run the equivalent manual test, rather than running the test case, `cmd` and `msg` can refer to how to do that, like with this example for the Bash track:

```json
{
  "tests": [
    {
      "name": "no name given",
      "cmd": "two_fer.sh",
      "msg": "We tried running `two_fer.sh` without an argument, but got the following error:\n\n%{output}"
    },
    {
      "name": "a name given",
      "cmd": "two_fer.sh Alice",
      "msg": "We tried running `two_fer.sh Alice`, but got the following error:\n\n%{output}"
    }
  ]
}

```

### Test order

We only show one error message to a user when one or more tests fail. If multiple tests fail, we show the first test that is listed in the `tests` array of the `.meta/config.json`. It is therefore important to structure the `tests` array from easiest to hardest (simple cases first, edge cases last).

We also use this file to guarantee at a website level that the correct tests have run. By checking the `results.json` against this list of tests, we can confirm that the user hasn't bypassed the test-running.

### Stub files

Each exercise should have a stub file that provides the minimal amount of code to help the user get started. It is vital that the stub file doesn't guide the user towards any specific approach.

If the user submits the stub file without modifications, the resulting error message should explain precisely what is expected of the user.

For example consider the following C# stub:

```csharp
public static string MyTestMethod(int i)
{
    throw new NotImplementedException("Please implement the MyTests.MyTestMethod method");
}
```

If the user would submit this code, the C# test runner output's would be:

> We tried running `MyTests.MyTestMethod(1)` but got the following error:
>
> ```
> Please implement the MyTests.MyTestMethod method
> ```

Note that we opted for using an exception instead of a compile error, as we can control the exception message but not the compiler message.
